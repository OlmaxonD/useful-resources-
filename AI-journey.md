# ML Journey

## The purpose is to understand ML Fundamentals not just to learn how to use certain ML libraries

_There are many roadmaps on the internet, on github as well._
_But they are either too advanced in the case of courses or filled with rabbit hole of links in the case of roadmaps._
_This roadmap intends be easy to be followed_

### Overal Plan:
- Get the overview of the concept from Josh Starmer's [StatQuest] channel
- Learn the implamentation (the calculations and code) using other resources such as Google cources, Khan academy, Microsoft etc
- Use Google Colabs as an environment

### Step1
1. [x] [Take Google's intro to ML](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/intro-to-ml) course
1. [Take Google's ML crash course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course). **Make sure to complete all the prework and Prerequisites***
1. Continue learning in order specified in [Google Foundational Courses] webpage

### Step2
1. Learn how to use ML libraries like pyTorch, TensorFlow, sckit-learn
